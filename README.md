# LandingPage
Landing Page Project using html,css and JavaScript.
This project about creating a multi-section landing page.
Specifically, how to make the website better by making it dynamic instead of static.
I implement a smooth scrolling navigation for the webpage with four sections.
For dynamic interaction, I use JavaScript, and for styling, I use CSS.
The user can scroll and move between sections. 
Also, navigate through different sections using a navigation bar,
which highlights the current section as they scroll.
overall, manipulating the DOM appending dynamically.
