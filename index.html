        <h3>Cultural blunders</h3>
        <p>The "How Are You?" Fiasco
          On a trip to France, Mr. English confidently approached a group of locals and greeted them with a cheery, “How are you?”
          expecting a friendly exchange. Instead of the casual small talk he was used to, the locals looked baffled. 
          One even raised an eyebrow and responded with a lengthy explanation of his day’s struggles.
          
          Realizing his mistake, Mr. English later learned that in French culture,
          such questions often require more than a simple “fine.” From then on,
          he stuck to “Bonjour” and a smile, much to the relief of those around him.
        </p>

        <p>Mr. English’s cultural blunders may have stemmed from his eagerness to connect with people,
          but each misunderstanding brought him closer to understanding the beauty of diverse cultures.
          His experiences serve as a reminder that while social misunderstandings can be embarrassing,
          they often lead to the best stories and laughter, bridging gaps in ways that formal introductions never could.
